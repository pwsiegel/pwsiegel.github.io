title: What is the moral basis for the pro-life argument?
abstract: "In theory, the premise of the pro-life argument is simple: the right to life is sacrosanct, abortion ends a life, and therefore abortion is wrong. But I find it very difficult to reconcile this premise with the rest of morality."

On Christmas eve of 2009, Texas resident Ezekiel Gilbert responded to a Craigslist ad for escort services posted by 23 yeard old Lenora Frago.
Gilbert invited Frago to his home and paid her \\$150 for her services.
They disagreed on whether or not sex was included in the price, and ultimately Frago refused to have sex with Gilbert or return his \\$150.
As she fled to her car, he pursued her with a gun and shot her in the neck, paralyzing her.
She succumbed to her wound 7 months later.

At his murder trial in San Antonio, Gilbert's lawyers conceded that Gilbert had in fact shot Frago, but argued that his intent was to recover property that she had stolen from him, namely the \\$150 that he had paid her with the expectation of sex.
[Texas law](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.9.htm#D) is quite permissive about the use of deadly force to protect property:

> A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property... when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary... to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property...

The jury acquitted Gilbert in 2013 after 11 hours of deliberation.

## Where is the right to life?

Perhaps one could quibble over whether or not the jury correctly applied Texas law in Gilbert's case, but either way it is quite evident from the text of the statute that it does not at all treat the right to life as absolute.
It very clearly asserts that if a person's property rights are in tension with a burglar's right to life, then the property rights win.
(At least at nighttime, anyway.)

I find this moral calculation to be somewhat bizarre.
But the Texas legislature is entitled to resolve the calculation however it sees fit, as does every other state government in America.
The right to life is not explicitly protected anywhere in the Constitution, nor is there a body of federal case law which implicitly guarantees such a right.

The reason is simple: it is virtually impossible to run a society in which life is protected ahead of all other interests.
Military commanders must be empowered to risk the lives of their soldiers; doctors must choose between lives in resource-constrained operating rooms; organizations responsible for performing particularly dangerous jobs must accept some risk to the lives of their workers; and so on.

## And then there's the abortion debate

The inevitable tradeoffs between a person's right to live and other rights or interests are almost always acknowledged as part of the terms of debate.
Example: there are difficult and nuanced arguments over where the limits on a police officer's use of force should be set, but most people agree that enforcing laws is likely to require the use of lethal force in at least some circumstances.

The pro-life argument in the debate over the morality and legality of abortion is a glaring exception to this norm.
The National Right to Life Convention's [mission statement](https://www.nrlc.org/about/mission/) begins with:

> The mission of National Right to Life is to protect and defend the most fundamental right of humankind, the right to life of every innocent human being from the beginning of life to natural death.

Similarly, Americans United for Life [mission statement](https://aul.org/mission/) reads:

> We believe all human rights flow from the human right to life. We are all equal members of the human family and equally worthy of respect, solidarity, and love.

More generally, most pro-life advocates articulate some version of the following argument:

1. The human right to life is absolute.
2. Unborn fetuses are living humans.
3. Therefore, abortion is immoral because it violates a human's right to life.

Abortion is one of the most morally scrutinized practices in all of American society, so obviously the argument can be fleshed out in a lot more detail.
But I have always found it mysterious that the pro-life movement's opening argument denies the very _existence_ of the complex tradeoffs that lie at the heart of other questions related to the morality of life and death.
