title: Maintaining an investing portfolio across multiple accounts
abstract: My investment strategy for my retirement savings is to maintain exposure to the entire global stock market roughly in proportion to market cap weights. I can't implement this strategy in one of my retirement accounts, so I'm considering tilting one of my other accounts so that my overall portfolio has the right weights. In this post I'm going to work out the math that I'd have to do in order to achieve this.
